# 🥇 First Gold Medal Ever — and It’s MINE!  

It finally happened. My first **gold medal**, and it still feels unreal.  
At **iNVENT𝙓 MMU 2025**, that intense poster research competition I’d been stressing over for weeks — I actually took home the gold!  

---

## 🌱 The Idea That Won  
My project? A **simple yet powerful toolkit** designed to measure how eco-friendly **waste cooking oil (WCO)–based biofuels** really are — from start to finish.  

You know how everyone calls biofuels *“green energy”*? Well, I wanted to dig deeper and ask:  
> **“How green is this fuel, actually?”**  

The toolkit evaluates the entire life cycle of WCO-based biodiesel — from collection and processing all the way to emissions and carbon savings — and translates complex environmental data into clear, usable insights.  

It’s like having a sustainability dashboard for biofuels — simple, transparent, and built for real-world application.

## 🧠 Why It Matters  
Climate solutions are often praised without measuring their hidden footprints. By creating a tool that quantifies both the **benefits and trade-offs**, this project aims to help researchers, policymakers, and industries make **smarter, data-driven decisions** for a cleaner future.

## 🙏 Special Thanks  
A heartfelt **thank you to Dr. Siow Chun Lim**, my mentor and guide through every step of this journey. Your insights, patience, and encouragement made all the difference.

## 🚀 What’s Next  
Winning gold isn’t the finish line — it’s just the starting point.  
Next up: refining the toolkit, validating it with real-world data, and eventually transforming it into a **web-based LCA (Life Cycle Assessment) platform** that anyone can use to evaluate sustainable biofuels.  

Here’s to innovation, persistence, and turning kitchen waste into climate hope. 💚
