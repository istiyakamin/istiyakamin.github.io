**Master the Art of Building Autonomous AI Agents Using n8n, APIs, and LLMs**

---

## Course Objective
This course teaches you how to design, build, and deploy powerful **AI agents** capable of automating workflows, reasoning with data, and integrating with external tools — all powered by **n8n**, **OpenAI**, and **custom logic layers**.  
By the end, you’ll be able to build your own **autonomous AI systems** that perform real-world tasks with minimal human input.
