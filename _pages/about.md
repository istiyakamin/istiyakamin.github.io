I am a Master's student at Multimedia University (MMU) in Malaysia, studying Artificial Intelligence and Engineering. Right now, I'm working on a research project that uses computer science and data analysis to help make clean energy from used cooking oil. Before this, I worked for several years as a software engineer, where I learned a lot about Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. I want to use these skills to help solve real-world problems especially in making energy cleaner and greener. My next goal is to do a PhD in a field that combines Quantum Computing and Artificial Intelligence. I hope this will help me create smarter and more powerful technologies for the future, not just in Malaysia but around the world.
