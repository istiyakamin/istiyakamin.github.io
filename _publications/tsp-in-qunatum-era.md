The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) asks for the shortest tour that visits each city once and returns to the start. It is a classic NP-hard problem and a benchmark for optimization, logistics, and network design. This paper surveys classical, quantum, and hybrid algorithms for the TSP using clear, step-by-step explanations. We summarize how each method works, what it guarantees, and how it scales with the number of cities. We also discuss practical limits of current quantum hardware and outline open problems and promising research directions. While quantum techniques can speed up certain subroutines or offer strong heuristics, no known method solves general TSP in polynomial time. Our goal is to offer a readable yet rigorous map of the landscape for students and practitioners.
